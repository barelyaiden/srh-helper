# How To Set Up A Development Environment (For Contributors)

1. Fork the repository.
2. Run a terminal in the root directory of the project and use the `npm install` command to install all dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following code snippet inside:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=yourtokenhere
```
- **MAKE SURE TO REPLACE `yourtokenhere` WITH YOUR OWN TEST BOT ACCOUNT'S TOKEN.**
- **DO NOT SHARE YOUR TEST BOT ACCOUNT'S TOKEN AS THAT WILL ALLOW OTHERS TO RUN THEIR OWN (AND VERY LIKELY MALICIOUS) CODE ON YOUR TEST BOT ACCOUNT.**
4. Modify the `config.json` file with your own IDs and role names.
5. To deploy commands run the `node deploy-commands.js` command in your terminal.
- **THIS WILL REGISTER YOUR COMMANDS ONLY IN YOUR TESTING SERVER, THE ID OF WHICH YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE IN THE CONFIGURATION FILE.**
6. To start the bot use the `node .` command in your terminal (and stop the bot by using `Ctrl + C` inside your terminal).
